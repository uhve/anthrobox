# Minimal Anthropic-Inspired Zola Theme

A minimalist Zola theme featuring a color palette inspired by Anthropic and Gruvbox. Created as a Christmas holiday project.

## Features

- Lightweight (<20KB)
- No JavaScript
- Clean, readable typography
- Anthropic-inspired color scheme with Gruvbox influences
- Pure CSS implementation

## Status: Abandoned

This theme is currently in an abandoned state and requires significant work to be production-ready. Major items that need addressing:

### Known TODOs

1. **CSS Scope Leakage**: The Markdown CSS styling currently leaks outside its intended scope and needs proper containment
2. **Inconsistent Markdown Styling**: Need to standardize CommonMark schema to CSS theming mappings
